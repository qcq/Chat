# Chat

Chat is one app which try to implement the C/S archecture. Chat is based on the websocket as the message chaneel which makes the coding simple. Right now, This is just a scrach project which just begin.

## embeded tech

* websocket

    come to this time, when I check more options for C++ version of websocket, ther exist boost.beast
    except the websocketpp, but seems boost version is not easy to understand. But, I inist to learn
    it with patience.

* cmake

* gtest

* emake https://github.com/skywind3000/emake

    seems this compile method is more simpler than cmake, just need include main.mak

* consider add the support of protocal buf of google

* spdlog https://github.com/gabime/spdlog

    with spdlog to logging the log of project

## Hope for myself

## I hope I will insist on this project, which can be one behalf project of mine
